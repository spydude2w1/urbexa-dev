# URBEXA GROUP — DESIGN & UI RULES

This document defines the non-negotiable design, UI, motion, and content rules for all Urbexa Group web properties.

These rules exist to maintain consistency, restraint, and long-term scalability.
They must be followed for all new pages, components, and edits.

If in doubt, choose less.

---

## 1. BRAND POSITIONING

- Brand name: **Urbexa Group**
- Industry: Urban residential & commercial construction & development
- Focus: Execution, quality, clarity, control, long-term accountability
- Audience: Residential homeowners today, development-scale clients tomorrow

The brand must never feel:
- promotional
- flashy
- experimental
- startup-like
- boutique or artsy

The brand must always feel:
- calm
- serious
- controlled
- established
- scalable

---

## 2. CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

- Quiet luxury
- Architectural restraint
- Material over decoration
- Weight over motion
- Presence over noise

The site should feel solid and considered even when nothing is moving.

---

## 3. COLOR SYSTEM (STRICT)

### Base Palette
- Charcoal / graphite / near-black backgrounds
- Off-white or soft grey text (never pure white)

### Accent Color
- Gold accent only: `#EFD2A2`

Gold usage is micro-only.

Allowed:
- thin dividers
- underlines
- hover states
- subtle gradients
- active indicators

Never use gold for:
- large background fills
- body text
- filled buttons
- decorative elements

If gold is visually obvious, reduce intensity by at least 30%.

---

## 4. TYPOGRAPHY

- Neutral, modern, architectural fonts
- Large headings with restrained weight
- Comfortable line height
- Minimal bolding

Avoid:
- playful fonts
- decorative serifs
- exaggerated letter spacing
- dramatic contrast

Text should read like documentation, not persuasion.

---

## 5. MOTION & INTERACTION

Motion style:
- slow
- weighted
- dampened
- Apple-like

Allowed:
- soft fade-ins
- slight vertical movement
- inertia-based cursor and mesh motion
- low-amplitude parallax

Forbidden:
- bounce or elastic easing
- fast transitions
- flashy animations
- attention-seeking effects

If motion is noticeable, slow it down.

---

## 6. CURSOR RULES

- Custom cursor must be stable, heavy, and reliable
- Cursor must never jump, snap, teleport, or reflow

Technical rules:
- position: fixed
- requestAnimationFrame driven
- no React state for hover detection
- no transform stacking

If cursor behavior becomes unstable, simplify immediately.

---

## 7. BACKGROUNDS

Allowed:
- abstract architectural textures
- concrete, plaster, stone grain
- light and shadow geometry
- mesh or wireframe surfaces

Background rules:
- low contrast
- desaturated
- layered under gradients
- must not compete with content

Never use as backgrounds:
- people
- lifestyle imagery
- city skylines
- interior décor
- finished house photos

Portfolio imagery is not background imagery.

---

## 8. LAYOUT

- Strong grid discipline
- Generous whitespace
- Calm spacing
- Clear hierarchy

Avoid:
- dense sections
- cluttered grids
- stacked cards
- visual noise

If a section feels busy, remove something.

---

## 9. CONTENT & COPY

Tone:
- observational
- neutral
- confident
- non-promotional

Avoid language such as:
- “passion”
- “we believe”
- “world-class”
- “best-in-class”
- “trusted partner”
- “solutions”

Write like:
- a process document
- an execution note
- a professional memo

If it sounds like marketing, rewrite it.

---

## 10. NEW PAGE & COMPONENT RULE

Every new page or component must:
- use the existing color palette only
- use existing typography scale
- use existing motion patterns
- introduce no new visual language
- add clarity, not excitement

A new page should feel like it always belonged.

---

## 11. GOLDEN RULE

When choosing between:
- more
- less

Always choose **less**.

Luxury survives subtraction.

---

## 12. AI USAGE RULE (IMPORTANT)

When using AI tools (Amazon Q, Copilot, etc.), always prepend:

“Follow the Urbexa Group Design & UI Rules strictly. Do not introduce new styles, colors, motion patterns, or tone.”

If AI output violates these rules, it must be rewritten.

---

End of rules.
